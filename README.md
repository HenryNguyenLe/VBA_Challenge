## VBA_Challenge

This is Henry_Le's repository for source code to scan through multiple stock data, analyze gain/ loss and summarize the greatest gain/loss stock names.

The source codes employed several techniques including:
  * Looping through multiple spreadsheets inside the workbook.
  * Looping through every rows inside the worksheet and find the gain/ loss of each stock.
  * Building summary table on the right side of the original data by setting the reference "coordinate" and use ".Offset() function.
  * Building "If" statement to avoid "zero-division" and group all stock with same name into one row in the summary table.
  * Color-coding to quickly identify positive gain in green and negative loss in red.
  
THANK YOU for Viewing my codes!
